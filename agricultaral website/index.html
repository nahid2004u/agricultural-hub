    <b>History of Bangladesh’s Agriculture</b><br>
The history of agriculture in Bangladesh is deeply connected with its rivers, fertile land, and rural life. From ancient times, agriculture has been the main occupation of the people and the backbone of the country’s economy.

In ancient Bengal, farming developed along the river valleys of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. Farmers mainly cultivated rice, jute, pulses, and oilseeds using traditional tools and natural irrigation from seasonal floods. During the medieval period, agricultural production expanded, and rice became the staple food of the region.

Under British colonial rule (1757–1947), agriculture was reshaped to serve colonial interests. Cash crops like jute and indigo were promoted, often at the expense of food crops. This period caused hardship for farmers and led to food shortages and famines.

After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the government took major steps to improve agriculture. Modern farming methods were introduced, including high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilizers, irrigation systems, and mechanization. The Green Revolution played an important role in increasing rice production and achieving food security.

Today, Bangladesh’s agriculture has become more diversified. Along with rice, farmers grow wheat, maize, vegetables, fruits, fish, and livestock. Modern technology, research, and climate-resilient farming practices are gradually shaping the future of agriculture, while it continues to support millions of livelihoods across the country.
